# Wardrobe
A wardrobe management system. A user should be able to login,
view an uploaded catalog of clothing, and then allow
separate articles to be chosen to become a part of the outfit.

## Concept
This project is part of the [Codesmith LLC](http://codesmith.io) solo project.
The idea was requested by my daughter, a fan of the movie [Clueless](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112697/)
and fashion. 

# Database Schemas
